# IT206-EndSemProject
This is endsem project for our 2nd Semester. I have created this project along with my freind-Harsh Patel. This project is basically a Snake and Ladder game, implemented using concepts of OOPs.

## Software required
It is suggested to use codeblocks, otherwise one needs to take all the files and then add then in another file to run the program.
